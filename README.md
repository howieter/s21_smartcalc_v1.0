## Description

In this project I implemented an extended version of the usual calculator in the C programming language using structured programming. In addition to basic arithmetic operations such as add/subtract and multiply/divide, I supplemented the calculator with the ability to calculate arithmetic expressions (sine, cosine, logarithm, etc.).

Besides calculating expressions, it also support the use of the _x_ variable and the graphing of the corresponding function.

As for other improvements it supports a credit and deposit calculator.

## Goal and requirements

* implemente the Dijkstra's algorithm and reverse Polish notation in C language
* create GUI using C++(QT 5)
* learn more about basic structures, algorithms, OOP and desktop applications.

## Build
All commands to build and test program you can find in Makefile.

In the folder "Materials" you can find the already builded app.

## P.S.
Thanks School_21 for providing this task.
